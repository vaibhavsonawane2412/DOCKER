# Deploying React App with Docker Containers

## Introduction
This documentation outlines the process of deploying a React app using Docker containers. Docker containers provide a consistent environment for running applications, making deployment more predictable and scalable.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Docker.
- Docker installed on your local machine.
- Access to the React app source code.

## Directory Structure
```
project/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
└── src/
    ├── App.js
    ├── index.js
    └── ...
```

## Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
# Use Node.js LTS image as base (I'm not specify any version for node so it will take latest version of it.)
FROM node

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /myapp

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json file in the current path
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies for Node.js 
RUN npm install 

# Copy remaining source files
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000.
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the React app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Building the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t my-react-app .
```

## Running the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
```

## Accessing the Deployed App
Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the deployed React app.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues during deployment, ensure Docker is installed correctly and that the necessary ports are not in use.

## Conclusion
Deploying a React app with Docker containers offers numerous benefits, including environment consistency and scalability. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can easily deploy your React app using Docker containers.
